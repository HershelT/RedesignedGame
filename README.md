# Python Terminal API

## Description
Using Graphics Engine API. Well structured in a folder, I present the newly packaged PYTHONTERMINALGRAPHICSAPI. I am pleased to say this is the newst version of the engine.

We are using the most advanced features presently written to create multiple layers and scenes in order to give the user experience the most positive feedback. 

I have used maps, map readers, classes and functions to create a more dynamic and interactive experience.
New use case of code is the ability to add animations and interact with certain sections of the screen without interfering with the rest of the drawing onto screen.

With well mapped out code, I have created an efficient and poweful way to display graphics using the terminal.
## IN Beta
Have not finished and Am still working rest of README IS temporary

## Features
- Create and manipulate graphical elements such as shapes, lines, and text.
- Handle user input to enable interactive functionality.
- Support for various graphical effects and animations.
- Easy-to-use API with comprehensive documentation and examples.

## Installation
To use the Python Terminal API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/hershelt/RedesignedGame.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## GOAL
A strategy based game to collect the loot.
The goal of the game is to collect all the ores in the level and reach the exit. You can break blocks with a pickaxe and push blocks around to help you reach the ores. You can also use tnt to blow up blocks and collect ores. Be careful not to end the game by running out of hearts. You can collect diamonds to get a health potion to use.

## Usage
Run game using `python game.py`

Move around using 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' keys

Break blocks with pickaxe using the 'e' key
Push around blocks by running into them if they are pushable.

Push tnt blocks near the ores and press 'b' to blow them up

Collect ores by running into them.

Press 'z' and 'c' to move between levels and press 'm' to reset the level.

NOTE: everytime you use your flint and steel, you will lose 1 heart.

Collect 3 diamonds and press 'q' to get a health potion to use.

Press 'v' to use the health potion. This will give you 1 heart and allow you to continue playing.
